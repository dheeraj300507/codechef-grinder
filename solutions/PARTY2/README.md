## Problem Summary
Chef wants to host a party for $N$ friends. Each friend consumes one burger, and each burger costs $X$ rupees. Chef currently has $K$ rupees in his pocket. We need to determine if Chef has enough money to pay for all the burgers required for his friends.

## Intuition & Mathematical Observation
The total cost of the party is the product of the number of friends ($N$) and the cost per burger ($X$). 
- Total Cost = $N \times X$

Chef can afford the party if and only if his total available money ($K$) is greater than or equal to the total cost.
- Condition: $N \times X \le K$

If the condition holds, we output "YES"; otherwise, we output "NO". Given the constraints ($N, X \le 100$), the maximum possible cost is $10,000$, which easily fits within standard integer types.

## Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: $O(1)$ per test case, as the solution involves a simple multiplication and comparison. For $T$ test cases, the total time complexity is $O(T)$.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$, as we only use a few variables to store the input and the result.

## Solution Code

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

/**
 * Problem Analysis:
 * Chef has N friends and each burger costs X.
 * Total cost required = N * X.
 * Chef has K rupees.
 * Chef can afford the party if (N * X) <= K.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * N, X <= 100, K <= 10000.
 * N * X max value is 100 * 100 = 10000.
 * Since 10000 fits in a standard 32-bit integer, 'int' is sufficient.
 * Time complexity per test case: O(1).
 * Total time complexity: O(T).
