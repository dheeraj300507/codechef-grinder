/**
 * Problem Analysis:
 * Alice has A chocolates and Bob has B chocolates.
 * Total chocolates = A + B.
 * To distribute them equally between two people, the total number of chocolates
 * must be divisible by 2.
 * If (A + B) % 2 == 0, then each person gets (A + B) / 2 chocolates.
 * Since we cannot break chocolates, this is the only condition required.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= T <= 1000
 * 1 <= A, B <= 10^5
 * A + B will be at most 2 * 10^5, which fits comfortably in a standard 32-bit integer.
